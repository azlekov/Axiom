## Cross-Domain Routing

**Widget + data sync** (widget not showing updated data):
- Widget timeline not refreshing → **stay here** (extensions-widgets)
- SwiftData/Core Data not shared with extension → **also invoke axiom-data** (App Groups)

**Live Activity + push notification**:
- ActivityKit push token setup → **stay here** (extensions-widgets)
- Push delivery failures → **also invoke axiom-networking** (networking-diag)
- Entitlements/certificates → **also invoke axiom-build**

**Push + background processing** (silent push not triggering background work):
- Push payload and delivery → **stay here** (push-notifications-diag)
- BGTaskScheduler execution → **stay here** (background-processing)

**Calendar/Contacts + data sync**:
- EventKit/Contacts data issues → **stay here**
- Shared data with widget via App Groups → **also invoke axiom-data**

#### watchOS surfaces
- Complications + Smart Stack widgets → See axiom-watchos (skills/smart-stack-and-complications.md)
- Live Activities on Apple Watch → See axiom-watchos (skills/controls-and-live-activities.md)

## Conflict Resolution

**integration vs axiom-build**: When system features fail with entitlement/certificate errors:
- Use **axiom-build** for signing and provisioning issues
- Use **integration** for API usage and permission patterns

**integration vs axiom-data**: When widgets or extensions can't access shared data:
- App Groups and shared containers → **axiom-data**
- Widget timeline, Live Activity updates → **integration**

**integration vs axiom-media**: When media features overlap with system features:
- Camera/photo/audio/haptics code → **axiom-media**
- Privacy manifests for camera/microphone → **stay here** (privacy-ux)
- Background audio mode → **stay here** (background-processing)

## Anti-Rationalization

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "App Intents are just a protocol conformance" | App Intents have parameter validation, entity queries, and background execution. |
| "Widgets are simple, I've done them before" | Widgets have timeline, interactivity, and Live Activity patterns that evolve yearly. |
| "Localization is just String Catalogs" | Xcode 26 has type-safe localization, generated symbols, and #bundle macro. |
| "Push notifications are just a payload and a token" | Token lifecycle, Focus levels, service extension gotchas cause 80% of push bugs. |
| "I'll just bundle the assets, it's simpler" | Bundling ≥10 MB inflates first-install size and pays the cost every update. Background Assets ships with App Store install-progress integration; FM adapters can't be bundled at all. See `skills/background-assets.md`. |
| "I'll use URLSession for the asset download" | URLSession doesn't integrate with App Store install progress, charging-aware scheduling, or per-app quota — and can't reach Apple-hosted asset packs at all. Background Assets is the supported channel. |
| "Just request full Calendar access" | Most apps only need to add events — EventKitUI does that with zero permissions. |
| "I'll use CNContactStore directly for picking" | CNContactPickerViewController needs no authorization and shows all contacts. |
