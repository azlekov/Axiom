# Localization Research & Consistency Reference

Pre-translation and post-translation discipline for shipping localized apps that match platform conventions. Covers the research and consistency work that determines whether translations feel *native* or feel *machine-translated*.

## When to Use This Reference

Use this reference when:

- Matching app terminology to Apple's platform vocabulary (Music, Mail, Calendar, Photos, Settings)
- Building a project glossary before a translation pass
- Writing translator context for VoiceOver-only strings
- Stress-testing layout before real translations arrive
- Choosing a Translation Management System (Crowdin, Lokalise, Phrase, SimpleLocalize)
- Preparing for Apple Design Award Inclusivity review
- Auditing existing translations for consistency or platform-match

**Do NOT use this reference for:**
- Xcode String Catalog setup → see [Localization & Internationalization](/skills/integration/localization)
- Plural handling, RTL, locale-aware formatting → see [Localization & Internationalization](/skills/integration/localization)

## Example Prompts

Questions you can ask Claude that will draw from this reference:

- "How does Apple Music translate 'Up Next' in French?"
- "How do I build a localization glossary for my app?"
- "Should I pseudolocalize before paying for translations?"
- "Which Translation Management System should I use for an `.xcstrings` project?"
- "How should I write translator comments for VoiceOver accessibility labels?"
- "What's the difference between Accented Pseudolanguage and Double-Length Pseudolanguage?"

## What's Covered

### Apple Terminology Matching
- Apple Support multi-locale pages (authoritative cross-check)
- applelocalization.com (community database, sanity-check only)
- 15 highest-impact terms for media apps
- URL-swap workflow for locale comparison

### Project Termbase (Glossary)
- What belongs in a termbase (6 categories)
- Markdown table format with source attribution
- When to build it (before first translation pass, new locale, ADA prep)
- Storage location options

### VoiceOver-Aware Comments
- Why spoken strings need different translation than visible labels
- `VoiceOver:` comment prefix convention
- Pairing with `.accessibilityLabel` and `.accessibilityHint`

### Pseudolocalization
- Four Xcode scheme modes (Accented, RTL, Double-Length, Bounded String)
- When to run each
- Workflow sequence to catch hardcoded strings, layout breaks, and RTL bugs

### Translation Management Systems
- When a TMS is warranted (3+ locales, team review workflow)
- Comparison of Crowdin, Lokalise, Phrase, SimpleLocalize
- Round-trip workflow with `.xcstrings`
- Termbase integration

### Pre-Submission Workflow
- 8-step sequence from pseudolocalization through device testing
- Ordered to minimize cost of late-discovered issues

## Key Pattern

### Apple Terminology Cross-Check

```
1. Find Apple Support article covering the term
   → support.apple.com/en-us/<article-id>
2. Swap locale segment to target language
   → support.apple.com/fr-fr/<article-id>
3. Extract Apple's canonical translation
4. Record in project glossary with source attribution
```

### VoiceOver Translator Comment Convention

```swift
String(
    localized: "Double tap to change artwork",
    comment: "VoiceOver: spoken hint for the artwork button. Not visible on screen."
)
```

The `VoiceOver:` prefix signals to translators (and TMS filters) that the string is spoken, not read — so it should be translated as a full spoken instruction rather than a UI label.

## Documentation Scope

This page documents the `localization-research-ref` skill in the `axiom-integration` suite. It complements the mechanics-focused [Localization & Internationalization](/skills/integration/localization) reference by covering the research and consistency discipline that surrounds the Xcode workflow.

**For the Xcode/xcstrings mechanics:** see [Localization & Internationalization](/skills/integration/localization).
