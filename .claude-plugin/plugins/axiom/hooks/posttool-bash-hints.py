"""PostToolUse hook that suggests an Axiom skill based on Bash output.

When the model runs a Bash command, this hook scans the command's output
for known iOS error signatures and prints a short ``💡 Try: skill X``
hint on stdout. Each hint is one line; multiple hints can fire from a
single command. The hook never blocks the tool flow and never exits
non-zero — a broken hook shouldn't get in the way of normal work.

Replaces the inline bash one-liner that previously lived in
``hooks/hooks.json`` (PostToolUse Bash matcher). Extracted so we can:

1. Add unit tests (see ``posttool-bash-hints_test.py``).
2. Use ``duration_ms`` (added to PostToolUse input in CC 2.1.119) for
   duration-aware rules — currently used by the slow-xcodebuild and
   slow-test rules in this script's sibling phase.

Input:

    JSON on stdin (PostToolUse shape, per code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks):

        {
          "session_id": "...",
          "tool_name": "Bash",
          "tool_input": {"command": "...", ...},
          "tool_response": {...},          # Bash response shape undocumented
          "duration_ms": 12345,            # optional, ms
          ...
        }

    Bash output text on the ``CLAUDE_TOOL_OUTPUT`` env var. We read this
    rather than ``tool_response`` because the latter's Bash schema is
    not documented; the env var is proven (used by the previous inline
    hook). If the var is unset, we treat output as empty.

Output:

    Zero or more lines on stdout, each starting with ``💡``. Each line
    is a self-contained hint the agent can act on.

Exit code: always 0.
